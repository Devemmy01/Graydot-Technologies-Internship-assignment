# Drag and Drop Solution

This project provides a simple implementation of drag-and-drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to run and test the drag and drop solution:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. The web page will display two containers side by side. The left container contains a list of draggable items, and the right container is initially empty.

4. To drag an item, click and hold on the item, and then move the mouse cursor.

5. Drag an item from the left container and drop it into the right container. The dropped item will be added to the right container.

6. During dragging, the appearance of the dragged item will change to provide visual feedback.

7. When an item is dropped into the right container, a success message will be displayed briefly.

8. To reset the containers, click the "Reset" button. It will clear the right container and move all items back to the left container.

## Compatibility

The drag and drop solution is compatible with modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
